									<h2>5. ACCESS TO SERVICE</h2>
									<p>5.1. The functionalities of the Service are provided in consideration of a fee, subject to free trial periods that may be offered on an exceptional basis and under limited conditions of duration and access. Pricing is set by Paperchain depending in particular on the extent of the features available, the duration of Subscription and the size of catalog whose data and information may be consulted.</p>
									<p>5.2. In order to access the Service, each User must create beforehand an Account including compulsory information (such as their name, contact details, valid email address, etc.) which must be accurate and sincere (hereinafter an “Account“).</p>

Paperchain reserves the possibility to refuse the registration or subscription of any User, who may have caused difficulties in the past in relation to invoice payments or whose behavior may have proven to be contrary to these TOS or to applicable legislation.</p>

<p>When creating an Account, the User will take out a Subscription or will be invited to use the Service as part of another User‘s Subscription:<br>

- The “Subscribed User” subscribes to a paid Subscription and is responsible for its payment and for all Users to whom they grant consulting and administration permissions for this Subscription.<br>

- The User without a Subscription is invited and appointed by a Subscribed User, directly or by the intermediary of another User acting on their behalf, to access to all or part of the Service within the Subscription taken out by the Subscribed User  and, where applicable, may be granted administrative powers on the Subscription (payments, operations relating to invoicing, invitation of other Users, etc.), depending of the rights granted by the Subscribed User. </p>

<p>The Subscribed User, as the person responsible for the Subscription to the Service, has the possibility to invite other Users to access their Subscription, according to the delegations and access permissions they determine. As such, the Subscribed User acknowledges and agrees that all of their Users shall comply with these TOS in their entirety and guarantees such compliance on their behalf, being reminded that any breach by a User in the context of a Subscription may have an effect on the Subscription as a whole.
</p>
	<p>5.3. Paperchain may allow new Subscribed Users (and any other User authorized by the latter) to access the Service free of charge for a limited period of time from the date of creation of a new Subscribed User Account (hereinafter the “Trial Period”). At the end of this Trial Period, the User will be free to take out a Subscription in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 below or to cease using the Service.</p>
	<p>5.4. Each Account is personal and may not be used by anyone other than the User. It cannot be transferred, shared or assigned to a third party, even between Users of the same company, entity or group, or more generally between Users who depend on the same Subscription.</p>
<p>Each User undertakes to keep their login details private and confidential and not to disclose them. Each User is solely responsible for access to their Account with their login and password, unless there is evidence of fraudulent use by a third party.
</p>
<p>5.5. An Account may be terminated at any time (i) by the User, as provided for in these TOS or (ii) by Paperchain in the event of a breach of the provisions of these TOS or violation of applicable legislation, or in the event of outstanding payments.</p>

<p>Users acknowledge and accept that the termination of their Account implies the permanent deletion of all data, settings, information saved therein, which may not give rise to any financial or other compensatory claim. Any breach by a User may entail the termination of the Subscribed User Account, of which they depend and who is responsible for them.
</p>
<p>5.6. <strong>Duration of Subscription</strong></p>

<p>Following the opening of their Account, if applicable following a free Trial Period, Users will be invited to choose the type of subscription which they intend to take out (hereinafter the “Subscription”).</p>

<p>The duration of each Subscription is chosen by the User on the basis of one or more months, starting from the day the Account is created.</p>

<p>Unless terminated before its expiry by the User, the Subscription will be tacitly renewed for the same duration as the one initially subscribed. For example, the Subscription will be renewed for a new duration of one month if the ongoing Subscription was monthly or for a new duration of twelve months if the ongoing Subscription was annual.</p>

<p>Unless agreed otherwise in writing by Paperchain, a Subscription may not be terminated before its term, except when a User wishes to benefit from data and/or functionalities pertaining to a higher level of Subscription, in which case the Subscription in progress will end from the effective date of the new Subscription. Such modification will be subject to Paperchain’s approval, in which case an amount corresponding pro rata to the duration of the remaining ongoing Subscription shall be deducted from the price of the new Subscription.
</p>
<p>5.7. <strong>Pricing conditions</strong></p>

<p>The financial terms of Subscription to the Service are expressed in United States Dollars excluding taxes.</p>
<p>The applicable monthly and annual rates are those indicated in the rate sheet in force on the day on which the Subscription is taken out. Subscription rates are subject to change by Paperchain, in which case they will apply to any contract period following their entry into force.</p>
<p>5.8. <strong>Terms of payment</strong></p>

<p>Depending on the duration of the Subscription chosen by the User, the fee is payable monthly, annually or at another frequency corresponding to the standard duration of the Subscription.</p>

<p>Payment management is handled by a third-party provider of Paperchain. Users are advised to review its terms of use and privacy policy, which are accessible at the links provided in a specific section of the Site.</p>

<p>The Subscribed User undertakes to provide Paperchain at once with all information necessary for invoicing. The Subscribed User (or any other User delegated by them and/or acting on their behalf)  shall proceed to the payment timely, using payment methods available on the Site (such as payment by credit card).</p>

<p>Unless otherwise stipulated or agreed, the Subscription fees are payable in advance. Failure to pay shall prevent accessibility and the normal and complete use of the Service.
</p>
<p>5.9. <strong>Termination of Subscription</strong></p>

<p>The Subscribed User (or any other User delegated by them and/or acting on their behalf) may terminate their Subscription directly from their Account online or by written notice to Paperchain, ℅ The Yard, 85 Delancey St, Suite 54, New York NY 10002 (United States) or by email at: hello@paperchain.io. Termination will be effective at the end of the current Subscription period, provided that the request has been sent at least 48 (forty-eight) hours before the end of the ongoing period, and until the end date such as indicated on the User Account.</p>

<p>The closing of a Subscribed User Account shall necessarily result in the termination of the current Subscription and will therefore occur at the end of the current Subscription period.
